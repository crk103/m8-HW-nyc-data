I am now bringing in the NYC data of illegal pets complaints from the queens borough

```{r}
petcomplaints <- read.csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/erm2-nwe9.csv?complaint_type=Illegal+Animal+Kept+as+Pet&borough=Queens")

head(petcomplaints)
```
```{r}
sanitationcomplaints <- read.csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/erm2-nwe9.csv?agency_name=Department+of+Sanitation&borough=Queens")

head(sanitationcomplaints)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
